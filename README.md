Tips Prediction 

This project uses a dataset of restaurant tips to build a machine learning model that predicts how much tip a customer will give based on features like total bill, gender, smoker status, day, time, and party size.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the classic `tips` dataset from the Seaborn library.

Example columns:
- `total_bill`: Total bill amount (float)
- `tip`: Tip amount (float)
- `sex`: Gender of the customer (Male/Female)
- `smoker`: Whether the customer is a smoker (Yes/No)
- `day`: Day of the week (Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun)
- `time`: Time of day (Lunch/Dinner)
- `size`: Size of the dining party (int)

## 🔍 Objective

Build a regression model that accurately predicts the tip amount based on the given features.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib


## 🧠 Model Training

Models used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation Metrics:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We performed EDA to visualize:
- Correlation between total bill and tip
- Tips by gender and smoking status
- Distribution of tips across days and time
