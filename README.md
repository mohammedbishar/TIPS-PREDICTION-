Tips Prediction 

This project uses a dataset of restaurant tips to build a machine learning model that predicts how much tip a customer will give based on features like total bill, gender, smoker status, day, time, and party size.

The dataset used in this project is the classic `tips` dataset from the Seaborn library.

Example columns:
